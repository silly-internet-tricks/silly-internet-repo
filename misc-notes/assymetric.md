public and private key in assymetric encryption

gpg key 

I have the public key.

Everybody who has the public key, can encrypt messages for the owner.

the messages can't be decrypted again, without the private key.

So, the owner has to keep the private key secret

That way, he can read private messages intended only for him.

And anyone with the public key can send the messages encrypted for him

----------------------------------------------------------------------

public and private key in digital signatures

I have the private key.

Everybody who has my public key can use it to verify my digital signatures (if they have the plaintext that was signed)

(to get that plaintext, they presumably need to decrypt a message, which I encrypted using their public key as described above)

My digital signature cannot be generated by anybody else as long as I keep my private key secret.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

So, for a complete secure message to be sent, I should have your public key, and my private key.

So that I can sign my message using my private key and the hashed plaintext.

And, so that I can use your public key to encrypt the whole message so only you can receive it.

You should have your private key and my public key.

You need your private key to decrypt the whole message.

Then, you need my public key, (plus the plaintext message hash) to verify my signature.
