# Project Description

1. This is a collection of *userscripts* intended for use with the wonderful [Tampermonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) extension for the Google Chrome web browser.
1. They are developed using common library functions to make it quick to get new *userscripts* running with already existing features.
1. The github action publishes the compiled and minified *userscripts* to gists for easy management through the Tampermonkey extension's dashboard.
1. *Userscripts* could be anything!
